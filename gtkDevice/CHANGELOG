1.9-4

-  When using an embedded device, messages about the graphics context being NULL
   when the widget has not yet been realized no longer appear.

1.9-3

- Updated the code to initialize color correctly (R_RGB(0, 0, 0) rather than 0)
  so that lines are visible.

- Return immediately from clipping which appears to fix the resizing and
  "black" polygon problem.
  This should be fixed entirely, but since canClip is FALSE for this device,
  it appears an appropriate fix for the present.

1.9-2
- gtkDevice now returns an error in the absense of RGtk
- Added PACKAGE argument to all foreign function calls, conforming to 
  R CMD check

1.9-1
_ Graphics engine changes (from Paul Murrell) folded in
- New naming convention. Match the version number of the package to the
  R version. This is because gtkDevice still relies on unstable/undocumented
  parts of the R API and is sensitive to changes in the graphics engine

0.5-4
- Clipping rectangle setting now uncommented.
- .C() calls use PACKAGE argument to avoid symbol in base.

0.5
- Porting to gtk+ 2.0

0.4
- renamed package from gtk to gtkDevice
- configure script modified to use pkg-config (when available)
  now exits abnormally if it cannot find pkg-config or gtk-config
- asGTKdevice requres() RGtk
- man page for gtk corrected to describe new behaviour
- loadGTK renamed to loadGTKdevice
- Formatting changes
- Removal of obsolete ptr_GTKDeviceDriver from loadGTK.c

0.3 
- Man pages included
- R_gtk_setEventHandler called automatically in .First.lib
